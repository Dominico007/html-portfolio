 <h1>The Greatest TV Series According to Dominico</h1>
 <h2>My Top 5 All-time Series</h2>
 <hr size="3">

 <h3>1. Peaky Blinders</h3>
 <p>Thomas Shelby was just absolutely sensational in this. Good plot that should have had more seasons.</p>

 <h3>2. Vikings</h3>
 <p>Ragnar was just amazing overall; I also loved some of his sons, Bjorn Ironside, Ivar the Boneless, Ubbe and Hvitserk. Then my heart would always go to Lagertha and Bishop Heahmurd.</p>

 <h3>3. Friends</h3>
 <p>No sitcom could be anymore the perfect than this. It wasn't just comedy, but comedy with a wonderful storyline.</p>

 <h3>4. How I Met Your Mother</h3>
 <p>Absolutely sensational are just the right words for it. Every chaacter was just wonderful.</p>

 <h3>5. The Office</h3>
 <p>All I can say is, "lived it, loved it". A series after my own heart.</p>
